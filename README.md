# NumCrypt

<h1> Overview </h1>
<p> The project contains numerical algorithms for specific cryptographic purpose. </p> 

<p> As core functionality 2048-bit long arithmetic was created. Modular operations are optimized using a Barret reduction algorithm. </p>

<p> Finite fields arithmetic was created for specific cryptosystems. The polynomial and normal computational basis were implemented. </p>
